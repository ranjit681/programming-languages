# Neural Network Program using Keras/TensorFlow

This repository contains a simple Python program that demonstrates how to create and train a basic neural network using Keras, which is now integrated with TensorFlow.

## Overview

The provided Python script demonstrates the construction of a feedforward neural network using Keras API, comprising three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. This neural network is built for a basic classification task.

## Prerequisites

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.x)
- Keras (Integrated with TensorFlow)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-network-keras.git
   cd neural-network-keras

1. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow

1. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python neural_network.py

## Usage

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.x)
- Keras (Integrated with TensorFlow)
