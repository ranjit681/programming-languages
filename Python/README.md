Simple Feedforward Neural Network with Keras
This repository demonstrates how to create and train a simple feedforward neural network using Keras. The network consists of three fully connected layers with 128, 64, and 10 neurons, respectively. The network is trained on a dataset with inputs of shape (784,) and outputting 10 classes.

Prerequisites
TensorFlow and Keras installed
Steps
Import Libraries: Import TensorFlow and Keras libraries.
Python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
Use code with caution. Learn more
Model Creation: Initialize a sequential model using tf.keras.models.Sequential().
Python
# Create a sequential model
model = Sequential()
Use code with caution. Learn more
Adding Layers: Add Dense layers to the model using model.add(). Specify the number of neurons, activation functions, and input shapes for each layer.
Python
# Add layers to the model
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))
Use code with caution. Learn more
Model Compilation: Compile the model using model.compile(). Specify the optimizer, loss function, and metrics for evaluation.
Python
# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
Use code with caution. Learn more
Data Loading: Load your training data. Replace the placeholder comment with your actual data loading code.
Python
# Load your data (this is just a placeholder, actual data loading may differ)
X_train, y_train = load_data()  # Assuming X_train and y_train are your training data
Use code with caution. Learn more
Model Training: Train the neural network using model.fit(). Provide the training data (X_train and y_train) and training parameters (epochs and batch_size).
Python
# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
